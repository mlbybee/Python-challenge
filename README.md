Michelle Bybee-Moody 
Module 3 Challenge Assignment

Description:

This assignment includes two projects:

Project 1 = PyBank
Generating a script that analyzes financial records to determine the number of months in the dataset, the net total amount for profit/losses over the number of months. We also need to assess the average profit/losses thoughout that period and determine which month displayed the greatest increase and decrease in profit/losses. The script that is run also generates a text file that will display this information. 

Project 2 = PyPoll
Generating a script that evaluates election data. The script allows us to determine the total number of votes, provides a complete list of the candidates that received votes and the percentage of votes that each candidate tallied. With this information we can then calculate the total number of votes that each candidate won and determine the election winner. This script also generated a text file that will display this information.
